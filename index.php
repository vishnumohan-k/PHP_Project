    Web scraping (web harvesting or web data extraction) is a computer software 
    technique of extracting information from websites. Usually, such software programs 
    simulate human exploration of the World Wide Web by either implementing low-level
    Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), or embedding a fully-fledged web browser, 
    such as Mozilla Firefox.

    Web scraping is closely related to web indexing, which indexes information on the 
    web using a bot or web crawler and is a universal technique adopted by most search 
    engines. In contrast, web scraping focuses more on the transformation of unstructured
    data on the web, typically in HTML format, into structured data that can be stored and
    analyzed in a central local database or spreadsheet. Web scraping is also related to 
    web automation, which simulates human browsing using computer software. Uses of web 
    scraping include online price comparison, contact scraping, weather data monitoring, 
    website change detection, research, web mashup and web data integration.

    Web scraping is the process of automatically collecting information from the World
    Wide Web. It is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the 
    semantic web vision, an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in
    text processing, semantic understanding, artificial intelligence and human-computer
    interactions. Current web scraping solutions range from the ad-hoc, requiring human
    effort, to fully automated systems that are able to convert entire web sites into
    structured information, with limitations.
